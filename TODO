- Support click and drag
  - On mousedown, save current line
  - On mousemotion, adjust point, using X normally, but saved line instead of y
- Add Undo
  - All changes (so just price_points?) get saved for each graph in a list
  - Undo button applies last change backwards
  - Special for reset? Has to include all changes at once
  - If you want a global undo, then make a global list, and undo item objects include who their parent is so they can just be pushed to that list in order.
- Improve grid lines and axes?
