I want to give them up to 10 little graphs to make and then see how
what the aggregrate graph looks like to play with the space. What if
half the people had this demand pattern and half this one. or some of
them this and some that, what would the aggregate be?

I have a very clear picture of a good end result and zero plan for how
to achieve it. It doesn't need to save anything, its a toy to go with
a discussion of why economics 101 demand and supply graphs are
probably wrong

it seems like it shouldn't be too hard. The best user experience would
be being able to click on the graph to add a point. Alternatively a
table next to the graph to enter 10 points to get the curve if that is
too hard

I'd also put a text box under each of the ten graphs for the user to
write notes/a little story for why that consumer as the demand curve
they do

yes the points connected by straight lines
